Exercise 03

C++:

In C++, you can explicitly choose to pass an object by value or by reference.
By Value: A copy of the object is created. Changes to the copy do not affect the original.
By Reference: No copy is made. Changes to the reference affect the original object.

JavaScript:

In JavaScript, objects are always passed by reference. When you pass an object to a function or assign it to a new variable, you're passing a reference to the original object, not a copy.
